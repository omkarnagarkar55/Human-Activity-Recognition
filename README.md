# Online-Realtime-Action-Recognition-based-on-OpenPose
A skeleton-based real-time online action recognition project, classifying and recognizing base on framewise joints, which can be used for safety monitoring..   

------
## Introduction
*The **pipline** of this work is:*   
 - Realtime pose estimation by [OpenPose](https://github.com/CMU-Perceptual-Computing-Lab/openpose);   
 - Online human tracking for multi-people scenario by [DeepSort algorithm](https://github.com/nwojke/deep_sortv);   
 - Action recognition with DNN for each person based on single framewise joints detected from Openpose.
